# 10-Week Intern Execution Plan

## Week 1: Setup & Data
- Repo setup, env, Docker
- Fetch {TICKERS} data; exploratory analysis

## Week 2: Preprocessing
- Indicators, scaling, windowing; dataset artifacts
- Unit tests for preprocessing

## Week 3: Baselines
- Implement/train LSTM & Transformer
- Logging with MLflow

## Week 4: Evaluation
- RMSE/MAE, plots; error analysis
- Prepare baseline report snapshot

## Week 5: Bayesian I
- MC Dropout integration and calibration assessment
- Interval quality: coverage, sharpness

## Week 6: Bayesian II
- Pyro VI model; ELBO tuning; compare with MC Dropout

## Week 7: Backtesting
- Uncertainty-aware trading rules; Sharpe, VaR
- Sensitivity to thresholds

## Week 8: HPO & Ablations
- Optuna search; ablate uncertainty usefulness vs. accuracy-only

## Week 9: App & Docs
- Streamlit demo; AWS tutorial; finalize README

## Week 10: Report & Slides
- Finalize 2â€“4 page report and 12-slide deck
- Dry run presentation

# G-Research Application Checklist
- Project summary and link to repo
- Clear README, environment files, Dockerfile
- Unit tests passing; CI badge (if added)
- MLflow logs/screenshots; selected result plots
- Discussion on uncertainty impact for decisions
- Short demo video (Streamlit)
